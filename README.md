**PuMba** (**P**rotein-protein interface eval**u**ation with Vision **M**am**ba**) is a deep learning-based scoring function for protein-protein docking, designed to distinguish native-like from non-native conformations. It is an improvement of **PIsToN** [(Stebliankin et al., 2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00715-4), by replacing the Vision Transformer backbone of PIsToN with Vision Mamba.
